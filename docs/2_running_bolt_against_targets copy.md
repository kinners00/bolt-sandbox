## Inventory

Inventory for your targets can be stored in the ```inventory.yaml``` making your bolt commands easier to run and significantly shorter. You can specify groups and even subgroups of targets to use in your bolt commands. There are a bunch of useful examples shown in the ```inventory.yaml``` of this bolt project.
